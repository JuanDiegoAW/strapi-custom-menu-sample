# Strapi application

Sample showing how you can customize and classify the elements on the Left Menu of a Strapi project. 

# Resources classification 

In order to customize the menu, you need to override Srapi's messages.json file (https://github.com/strapi/strapi/blob/master/packages/strapi-admin/admin/src/components/LeftMenu/LeftMenuLinkHeader/messages.json) and the index.js file (https://github.com/strapi/strapi/blob/master/packages/strapi-admin/admin/src/containers/LeftMenu/index.js)

In this project, both files are located in admin/src/components/LeftMnu/LeftMenuLinkHeaders/messages.json and admin/src/containers/LeftMenu/index.js respectively. Any doubts as to how the code in those files work, are very welcome.
